# STAT3612-Project

## Outline:

### Eda

### Preprocessing (basically finished, can remove outliers later)

### Model
#### (1) Compare different models and conclude Logistic Regression has satifying accuracy compared with non-linear models - finished code, waiting for svm, rf to train. Note Logistic Regression test accuracy = 84.39%.
#### (2) Group insignificant categorical variables according to logistic regression.
#### (3) Address multicollinearity and other issues to further improve model.

### Interpretation (cannot do yet, need to finish model part (2) and (3) first)

### Conclusion (cannot do yet, need to finish Interpretation first)
